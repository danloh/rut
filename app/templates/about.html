            Readup.Tips' mission is to share and grow the knowledge about how to grow 
            one's knowledge. 
            <br>
            The mission based on the assumptions as following:
            <br>
            1, The best way to grow one's knowledge is reading, reading books, documentary,
            atlas, online course, etc., more accurate and systematic;
            <br>
            2, Bias, standpoint and perspective of the author, is inevitable and resonable for each book,
            to read up on a subject, we should go throuth a list of books by different authors;
            <br>
            3, Reading is costly, time or money, and there are huge number of books on each specific subject, 
            selecting a right list is important.
            <br>
            Let the books (or documentary, online-course) and readers find each other on help from who have read them. 
            Once master a knowledge, you grow. Then please thinking that the experience or
            road map of how you learn is also a huge treasure, which book or course or a list of books is better? 
            you should have many ideas, So share them, the rest of the world can benifit from your sharing, 
            You can also benefit from other's sharing.
            <br>
            You can also consider it as a tool to collect oe share your reading list/ to-read list/ have-read list.
