        <div> 
            Readup.Tips' mission is to share and grow the knowledge about how to grow one's knowledge. 
            The mission based on the assumptions as follows:
            <br>
            1. The best way to grow one's knowledge is reading, reading books, documentary,
            atlas, online course, etc., more accurate and systematic;
            <br>
            2. Bias, standpoint and perspective of the author, is inevitable and reasonable for each book,
            to read up on a subject, we should go through a list of books by different authors;
            <br>
            3. Reading is costly, time or money, and there are huge number of books on each specific subject, 
            selecting a right list is important.
            <br><br>
            Let the books (or documentary, online-course) and the readers find each other with the help from who have read them.
            <br> 
            We believe that the experience or roadmap about how you learned something is also a huge treasure: which book or 
            course or a list of books is better? you should have many ideas, So post to share them, the rest of the world can 
            benefit from your sharing, you can also benefit from other's sharing.
            <br>
            You can also consider it as a tool to collect or share your reading list/ to-read list/ have-read list.
            <br><br>
            A post is an item list, including some items like book, video or online resource and some reading tips for each item.
            You can star it if you find interesting, thus you create a bookmark for easier access, appreciate the creators' work and 
            show your taste.
            <br><br>
            You can take a items list(post) as challenge of the year or month or week or even of a day. there are some services to help you track your challenge. 
            <br>
            You can set a deadline, and excerpt clips from a book, post the spark of thought from any item to track your daily process, and review it when you get an item done. 
            <br><br>
            If you do not find something interesting, you can send a request on any subject, like 'I want to learn Python, which books or course is good?', and invite some experts to response, to get more response, you can share it to your SNS.
            <br><br>
