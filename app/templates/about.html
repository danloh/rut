            Readup.Tips' mission is to share and grow the knowledge about how to grow one's knowledge. 
            The mission based on the assumptions as follows:
            <br>
            1. The best way to grow one's knowledge is reading, reading books, documentary,
            atlas, online course, etc., more accurate and systematic;
            <br>
            2. Bias, standpoint and perspective of the author, is inevitable and reasonable for each book,
            to read up on a subject, we should go through a list of books by different authors;
            <br>
            3. Reading is costly, time or money, and there are huge number of books on each specific subject, 
            selecting a right list is important.
            <br><br>
            Let the books (or documentary, online-course) and the readers find each other with the help from who have read them.
            <br> 
            We believe that the experience or roadmap about how you learned something is also a huge treasure: which book or 
            course or a list of books is better? you should have many ideas, So post to share them, the rest of the world can 
            benefit from your sharing, you can also benefit from other's sharing.
            <br>
            You can also consider it as a tool to collect or share your reading list/ to-read list/ have-read list.
